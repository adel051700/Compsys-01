If you use the terminal, compile and run 'main.c' as follows:

Linux/Mac:
- To compile (linux/mac): gcc cbmp.c function.c main.c -o main.out -lm
- To run (linux/mac): ./main.out example.bmp example_inv.bmp

Windows:
- To compile (win): gcc cbmp.c function.c main.c -o main.exe -lm
- To run (win): main.exe example.bmp example_inv.bmp


The folder 'results_example' provides you with some example images obtained by running the algorithm. 

The folder 'samples' provides you with sample images for the 3 different levels of detection difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. Here you can also find the level 'impossible'. This level of difficulty is not part of the assignment. It is here just in case you really want to challenge your algorithm ;-)
